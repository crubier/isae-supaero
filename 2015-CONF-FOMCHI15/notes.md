# FOMHCI 2015 notes

## Interventions

### Benjamin Weyers

*Classical layered architecture*

  - Physical representation
  - Interaction logic
  - System interface
  - System logic

Workflow for HCI

  - Modeling phase
  - Use phase
  - Adaptation phase

FILL - formal interaction logic language

  - Operation nodes
    - System operation
    - Interaction-logic operation
    - Channel operation
  - BPMN nodes
  - Edges

Maps to reference nets (Petri net with annotations for types)

Double pushout graph rewriting on petri nets

### Judy Bowen

Combining models at different levels of abstraction
Different stakeholders, designers, programmers...

*Do with what we have and combine those*

The specification contains different artifacts

  - General behaviours
    - Z specification language
  - Simulation interface
  - Defined startup procedure
  - Defined shutdown procedure

*4 languages*

Z, microcharts, PIM, PRM


### Guillaume Maudoux

Concept of *safe mental model*

HMI LTS : Labelled Transition System with in and outs

Bad situations

  - A command missing on the system model
  - A command the user is not aware of
  - A variable is not observable for the user

Control property vs *Full control* property

Extract elementary tasks to teach to the user, from the LTS of the full system


### Johannes Pfeffer

Use a subset of BPMN to orchestrate apps workflows

RDF to store all data on chemical plants

*Orchestration engine* running on servers and on client devices, and interacts with apps

### Philippe Palanque

User centered design

*Norman's interaction theory*

### Camille Fayolas

Anik E-1 & E-2
1994-01-20 failure with a cost of 60M$

### Jos√© Campos

  - Theorem proving with PVS Based on higher order logic
  - Model checking with IVY and SMV, models as finite state machine

Layered specification

  - First layer constant and types related to devices and entities in the system
  - Second layer the underlying process ofen reused on families of devices
  - Third layer interfaces for devices
  - Fourth layer information resources

Represent the user in the formal language

How to proove that both representation (PVS and SMV) are simlar ? They have the same concepts, so the translation is mostly syntactic

### Bart Meyers

Meta model used to model DSLs

Use spin and promela
Properties in LTL are complicated

4 different DSL: Properties, system, configuration, state

DSLs are generated from the annotated meta model using UML stereotypes

*Everything is represented internally as a graph*

AtomPM a tool for multi paradigm modeling

Genetic algorithms for test case generation

## Discussions

### In the past

2 books on formal methods in HCI

  - Harrisson 1991 Patchwork
  - Patterno 1997 After CHI 1996

### The book

Deadline : 2015-12
Size : 400 Pages
Case study or not ? Yes, a chapter to generally describe each case, and then chapters can refer to them.

Structured along topics


  - Introduction
  - Analysis and Verification and Valdiation
  - Modeling
  - Execution
  - Future work
