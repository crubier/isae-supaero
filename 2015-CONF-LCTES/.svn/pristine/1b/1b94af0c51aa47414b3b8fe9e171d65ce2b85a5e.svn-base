\subsection{Basic constructs}

\subsubsection{Flows}
They encode state variables, input and output of 

Notion of activation/deactivation for continuous/discrete

\subsubsection{Interaction Operators}
Corresponding to equations

\subsubsection{Interaction components}

The basic interactors component

\subsubsection{Assembling interaction components}
Here we show how inteaction components are assembled and reused to build a new interaction component

\subsection{Formal semantics}
