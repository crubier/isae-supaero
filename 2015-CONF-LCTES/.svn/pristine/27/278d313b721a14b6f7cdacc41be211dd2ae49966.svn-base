\begin{itemize}
\item  A language for concurent interface design among different stakeholders, programming, verifying, testing
\item Code generation
\item prototype

\end{itemize}
Future  work
\begin{itemize}
\item Tool support 
\item Handling the description and the verification of a whole system including the human. We believe that the integration of the human is eased by the abstraction level in which LIDL components are described [CITER RUSHBY]
\item Verification of other properties, Honesty, freshness, device overload 
\item temporal properties related to delays and their impact on the architecture of the interface
 
\end{itemize}
