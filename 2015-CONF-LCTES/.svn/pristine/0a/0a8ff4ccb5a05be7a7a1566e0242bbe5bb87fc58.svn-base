To illustrate LIDL capabilities, we will use it to describe a simple graphical user interface (GUI). The example is a typical speed controller. Three modes are available: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \mono{Off}: Manual control of the speed
\item \mono{Lim}: Limiter, the speed should stay under a certain value
\item \mono{Ctrl}: Controller, the speed should stay around a certain value
\end{itemize}

Three buttons are available to control the target speed:
\begin{itemize}
\item \mono{+} to increment the target speed
\item \mono{-} to decrement the target speed
\item \mono{Cur} to set the target speed to the current actual speed
\end{itemize}
