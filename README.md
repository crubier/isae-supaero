# Projects

Here are some personal or academic projects I have executed in the last 10 years so !

## How to use

* Each folder is named after the year, the type of project, and a short description of it
* Each folder contains a file called `index` which contains the most important information (Report, readme, etc.)

## Caveats

* This repo is lacking most of my projects, including most pofessional projects, as they can't be published open source.
* The quality and depth of projects presented here is extremely variable: some projects are just a few files, and other projects are massive multi-month multi-gigabytes projects.
